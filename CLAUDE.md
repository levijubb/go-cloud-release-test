# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This is a test/sandbox repository for experimenting with Go builds and cloud build configurations in GitHub. It's a dummy Go project used for testing different build pipelines and CI/CD workflows.

## Project Context

- **Language**: Go
- **Primary Use**: Testing and sandboxing build configurations
- **Focus Areas**: GitHub Actions, cloud build systems, CI/CD experimentation

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run the demo app
go run main.go

# Build the binary
go build -o go-cloud-test

# Run the built binary
./go-cloud-test
```

## Development Approach

Since this is a testing/sandbox project, feel free to experiment with:
- Different Go module structures
- Various GitHub Actions workflows
- Cloud build configurations (GCP Cloud Build, etc.)
- Different build and deployment strategies
